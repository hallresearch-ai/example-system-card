- **Data preprocessing** (if applicable)
  Provide a short description of any ETL, data cleaning, annotation, labeling, or other preprocessing.
- **Data resources**:
  - **Training, validation, or testing data** (if applicable)
    Describe any data used for training and testing; include any relevant benchmark datasets.
  - **Knowledge bases or grounding sources** (if applicable) 
    Identify the knowledge sources used to ground system behavior.  
- **Vendor models or APIs***  (if applicable)
  Briefly identify each vendor-provided model, service, or API used.
- **Internally developed models** (if applicable)  
  Briefly identify each internally built model and its role.
- **Prompt or orchestration layers** (if applicable) 
  Describe any prompting, routing, planning, or orchestration logic.
- **Retrieval infrastructure** (if applicable) 
  Describe any retrieval layer used to find or rank information.
- **Business rules, guardrails, or filters** (if applicable) 
  Describe any rules, thresholds, filters, or policy logic applied.
- **Tool-use or action components** (if applicable) 
  Describe any tools, actions, or external system calls the system can trigger.

For each material component, document:
- **Software stack and version**  
  Note the relevant software, platform, or API version.
- **Inputs and outputs**  
  Name the main inputs received and outputs produced.
- **Key settings or parameters**  
  Note important settings, thresholds, or configurable parameters.

#### Human-in-the-loop (HITL) roles and interventions
Explain where people review, approve, correct, escalate, or override system behavior.

#### Upstream and downstream dependencies
Identify the systems, services, data sources, and processes this system depends on or affects.

### IV. Evaluation, Testing, and Validation

#### Performance metrics and results *
Report the main metrics used and the most important results.

#### Results across relevant segments, user groups, or subpopulations
Summarize performance differences across relevant groups, segments, or contexts.

#### Adversarial testing
Describe any testing for misuse, evasion, prompt attacks, or other adversarial behavior.

#### Visualizations / labeled plots *
Include clearly labeled figures that help explain evaluation results.

#### Testing remediation steps (if applicable)
Describe any fixes, mitigations, or follow-up actions taken in response to test findings.

#### Discussion of unexpected testing results
Note any surprising, inconsistent, or unexplained evaluation outcomes.

### V. Deployment, Monitoring, and Change Control

#### Monitoring plans and mechanisms *
Describe how system performance, safety, and reliability are monitored over time.

#### Change management and version control
Explain how changes are documented, reviewed, approved, and tracked.

#### Incident response plans
Summarize how incidents are detected, escalated, investigated, and resolved.

#### Appeals, overrides, and fallback procedures
Describe how decisions can be challenged, overridden, or safely backed up.

#### Maintenance expectations *
